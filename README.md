# Introduction
Use CMake to get current git repo's HEAD commit id and time.  
Then as preprocessor macros, they can be used in your code.  
Every time you use CMake as your build tools,  
the HEAD info is "Hard-Coding" into your executable or library,  
may sometimes be very helpful,  
eg. you want to directly know this .so file's code version.
